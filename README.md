## About

I’m a final-year AIML student with hands-on experience building **end-to-end ML systems and backend services** through internships, hackathons, and research projects.

My work spans:
- Deep learning (CV, NLP, LLM pipelines)
- Backend & APIs (FastAPI, Django REST)
- Distributed & cloud systems (GCP Dataproc, AWS, Docker)
- Vector databases & RAG systems

I focus on **practical, testable systems** rather than demos.
