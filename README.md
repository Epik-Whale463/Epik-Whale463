## 🤔 Who Am I?

I'm a final-year B.Tech AI/ML student who believes in writing code that doesn't just work, but works *well*. Currently turning caffeine into production-ready AI systems and occasionally solving LeetCode problems to prove I remember what algorithms are.

- 🔬 **Research Intern @ IIIT Nagpur** - Teaching machines to spot skin lesions (98.65% accuracy, not bad for artificial eyes!)
- 🚀 **Full-Stack AI Developer** - Building systems that serve 100+ users without catching fire
- 📊 **CGPA: 8.48/10** - Because perfect scores are overrated, but good enough scores get you places
- 🏆 **Problem Solver** - 100+ LeetCode problems conquered (and counting)

## 🚀 Projects That Actually Matter

### 🤖 Smart AI-Powered ATS Platform
*The system that makes HR's life easier (and mine more complicated)*

**Tech**: Flask, Python, Qdrant, LangChain, Docker
- Built a production-grade ATS that doesn't crash when 1000+ users hit it simultaneously
- Reduced resume screening time by 60% (HR teams everywhere rejoice)
- 95%+ parsing accuracy because "close enough" isn't good enough
- **Real impact**: Currently handling actual recruitment workflows

### 🔍 Metallic Surface Defect Detection
*Teaching computers to spot industrial flaws better than humans*

**Tech**: PyTorch, YOLOv8n, Tesla P100, Roboflow
- Trained on 2,760 images of metallic surfaces (yes, I looked at that many metal photos)
- GPU-accelerated training because waiting is for the patient
- **Published**: Available on Hugging Face for other researchers

### 🗣️ Telugu Text-to-Speech
*Making AI speak my mother tongue*

**Tech**: SpeechT5, HuggingFace, HiFi-GAN
- Fine-tuned SpeechT5 for Telugu using 8,576 audio samples
- **116+ downloads** on Hugging Face (people actually use this!)
- Built custom transliteration pipeline (because Telugu script is beautiful but complex)

### ⚡ LogFast - High-Performance Log Analyzer
*C++ project that processes logs faster than you can generate them*

**Tech**: Modern C++17, Threading, STL
- Custom thread pool architecture with lock-free operations
- Handles millions of log entries without breaking a sweat
- **Use case**: Perfect for high-frequency trading systems (if I ever go to Wall Street)

## 🏆 Real Achievements (Not Just Participation Trophies)

- **🥇 Code Spark Competition 2024** - 1st Place (HackerEarth platform)
- **🥇 Data Hunt Hackathon 2023** - 1st Place (Analyzed 75K+ airport records, helped solve a digital theft case)
- **🔬 Research Intern @ IIIT Nagpur** - Working on skin disease detection (98.65% sensitivity achieved)
- **📜 AWS Certified AI Practitioner** - Because cloud skills pay the bills
- **🎓 CGPA: 8.48/10** - Consistent performance without burning out

## 🎯 What I'm Currently Up To

- 🔬 **Research**: Improving skin lesion classification using ConvNeXt and ViT+CBAM hybrids
- 💼 **Building**: Production-ready AI systems that don't fall over under load
- 🧠 **Learning**: Advanced system design and LLM optimization techniques
- 📚 **Teaching**: Mentoring junior students in AI/ML concepts at AI HUB

## 💭 Philosophy

*"Code should be written for humans to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute."* 

I believe in building systems that are:
- **Reliable** - Works in production, not just on your laptop
- **Scalable** - Handles growth without architectural rewrites
- **Maintainable** - Future you (and your team) will thank you

## 📫 Let's Connect!

I'm always interested in discussing:
- AI/ML system architecture
- Production deployment challenges
- Research collaboration opportunities
- Why Python is simultaneously the best and worst language ever created

**Best way to reach me**: Drop an email at `rama.charan.official@gmail.com`  
**Response time**: Usually within 24 hours (unless I'm debugging something particularly stubborn)
